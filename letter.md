Re: Letter of Support for Hulden, Linquist, and Palmer, Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant Application

To whom it may concern:

I am writing to express my ardent support for the project "A Raw-Text Historical Newspaper Repository" by Hulden, Lingquist, and Palmer. Digital Humanities has a relative paucity of intermediate level tools of this nature, and it's my belief that the accessibility of the proposed tool, the compelling nature of the source material, and perhaps most importantly the fact that the data will be available unencumbered result in a tool of wide, multidisciplinary use. As text corpus analysis is one of the classic use cases for the digital humanities, I anticipate great uptake once the project is completed and accessible to the public.

CU Boulder is well known in DH circles as a centre for natural language processing expertise, and Martha Palmer is especially well known for her work in this field. I anticipate that the proposed corpus for this project -- especially the labour newspapers -- will be a great addition to future natural language projects, especially those that may deal with media from the same time period.

As a librarian heavily involved in digital humanities project consulting, I know that there's a real need, especially for new scholars, for tools that both go beyond the typical word cloud and are built with an interesting corpus in mind. This project contains both, is novel and exciting, and I very much look forward to working with it upon its completion.
