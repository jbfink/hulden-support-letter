Re: Letter of Support for Hulden, Linquist, and Palmer, Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant Application

To whom it may concern:

I am writing to express my ardent support for the project "A Raw-Text Historical Newspaper Repository" by Hulden, Lingquist, and Palmer. Digital Humanities has a relative paucity of intermediate level tools of this nature, and it's my belief that the accessibility of the proposed tool, the compelling nature of the source material, and perhaps most importantly the fact that the data will be available unencumbered result in a tool of wide, multidisciplinary use. As text corpus analysis is one of the classic use cases for the digital humanities, I anticipate great uptake once the project is completed and accessible to the public.
